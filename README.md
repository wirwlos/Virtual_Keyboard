#Virtual_Keyboard
This is a virtual keyboard that I created using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a basic project that I developed for my portfolio to showcase my front-end development skills.

The virtual keyboard can be accessed through any web browser. To use it, simply click on the keys with your mouse or tap them with your finger if you are using a touchscreen device. If you click on "Shift" or "Caps," the keyboard will capitalize the letters and change the set of numbers to symbols, similar to an English keyboard.

In the bottom right corner of the keyboard, you'll find a button that links to my LinkedIn profile.

Please note that there is a small bug in the keyboard. If you type more than 31 characters, the text will wrap to the next line. However, if you type more than around 120 characters, the text may go off the screen. I plan to fix this issue in the future by adding an if statement, but for now, it may be helpful to keep your text short.
